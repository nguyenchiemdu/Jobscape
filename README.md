## About our app
As the job market in Vietnam, a developing country, is transformed faster than ever, technical and vocational training plays an essential role in promoting our economic growth. However, getting the right and holistic set of industry-relevant skills is challenging, especially for newcomers. Fragmented information and mixed opinions about roadmaps can be confusing and overwhelming at times, while strict curriculum and training methods provided by one tutor or one platform do not offer much flexibility and adaptability for different learners. And here comes our application to the rescue! Jobscape is a trusted source for learning journeys, based on valued recommendations and insights from current professionals for the Vietnamese young learners who need a roadmap to their desired job.
